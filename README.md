# milestone-project-4

This project is inspired by looking for streams and finding dead links to a TV Show or Movie that you maybe want to view. This application is not strictly limited to streaming and in no way shape or form am I promoting or encouraging this application to be used for streaming links it was just an inspiration!. I want this application to be something else, ideally originally created user content that works with momentum based videos. If it's bad then it gets deleted if it's good then it stays. 


If a video link is rated -5 then the video gets deleted from the database unless someone else has saved (reposted) the video to their profile and in this circumstance a reposted (saved) video is only viewable and accessible to the user that has saved it.
